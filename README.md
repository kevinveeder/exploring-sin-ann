# 3D Sinusoidal Regression with Neural Networks
This project explores the use of artificial neural networks to model a noisy 3D sinusoidal dataset. The goal was to build and fine-tune a regression model using TensorFlow's Sequential API, and to manually experiment with key hyperparameters to better understand their effect on model performance and generalization.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives
- Load and preprocess 3D spatial data from a CSV file
- Visualize the training data in 3D space using Matplotlib
- Build, train, and evaluate a feedforward neural network
- Manually tune hyperparameters (layers, neurons, activations, learning rate, etc.)
- Generate prediction curves and compare them with training data
- Calculate generalization error using Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (scatter3D, view_init)
- Scikit-learn (train_test_split, StandardScaler, mean_squared_error)
- TensorFlow / Keras (Sequential, Dense, predict)

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations
- Initial 3D scatter plots of the training data from multiple viewing angles
- Model prediction curves superimposed on training data
- Comparison of different network configurations and their prediction quality

## Requirements
This project uses a jupyter notebook. Make sure to have these installed before opening the .ipynb file:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

I've also included a pdf copy as well.

# exploring-sin-ann
This project explores the use of artificial neural networks to model a noisy 3D sinusoidal dataset. The goal was to build and fine-tune a regression model using TensorFlow's Sequential API, and to manually experiment with key hyperparameters to better understand their effect on model performance and generalization.
